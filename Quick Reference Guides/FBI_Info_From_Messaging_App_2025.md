# iMessage

### iMessage is Apple’s instant messaging service. It works across Macs, iPhones, and iPads. Using it on Android is hard because Apple uses a special end-to-end encryption system in iMessage that secures the messages from the device they’re sent on, through Apple’s servers, to the device receiving them. Because the messages are encrypted, the iMessage network is only usable by devices that know how to decrypt the messages. Here’s what the document says it can access for iMessage:

* Message content limited.

* Subpoena: Can render basic subscriber information.

* 18 USC §2703(d): Can render 25 days of iMessage lookups and from a target number.

* Pen Register: No capability.

* Search Warrant: Can render backups of a target device; if target uses iCloud backup, the encryption keys should also be
provided with content return. Can also acquire iMessages from iCloud returns if target has enabled Messages in iCloud.

# Line

### Line is a freeware app for instant communications on electronic devices such as smartphones, tablets, and personal computers. In July 2016, Line Corporation turned on end-to-end encryption by default for all Line users, after it had earlier been available as an opt-in feature since October 2015. The document notes on Line:

* Message content limited.

* Suspect’s and/or victim’s registered information (profile image, display name, email address, phone number, LINE ID, date of
registration, etc.)

* Information on usage.

* Maximum of seven days’ worth of specified users’ text chats (Only when end-to-end encryption has not been elected and
applied and only when receiving an effective warrant; however, video, picture, files, location, phone call audio and other such
data will not be disclosed).

# Signal

### Signal is a cross-platform centralized encrypted instant messaging service. Users can send one-to-one and group messages, which can include files, voice notes, images and videos. Signal uses standard cellular telephone numbers as identifiers and secures all communications to other Signal users with end-to-end encryption. The apps include mechanisms by which users can independently verify the identity of their contacts and the integrity of the data channel. The document notes about Signal:

* No message content.

* Date and time a user registered.

* Last date of a user’s connectivity to the service.

This seems to be consistent with Signal’s claims.

# Threema

### Threema is an end-to-end encrypted mobile messaging app. Unlike other apps, it doesn’t require you to enter an email address or phone number to create an account. A user’s contacts and messages are stored locally, on each user’s device, instead of on the server. Likewise, your public keys reside on devices instead of the central servers. Threema uses the open-source library NaCl for encryption. The FBI document says it can access:

* No message content.

* Hash of phone number and email address, if provided by user.

* Push Token, if push service is used.

* Public Key

* Date (no time) of Threema ID creation.

* Date (no time) of last login.

# Viber

### Viber is a cross-platform messaging app that lets you send text messages, and make phone and video calls. Viber’s core features are secured with end-to-end encryption: calls, one-on-one messages, group messages, media sharing and secondary devices. This means that the encryption keys are stored only on the clients themselves and no one, not even Viber itself, has access to them. The FBI notes:

* No message content.

* Provides account (i.e. phone number)) registration data and IP address at time of creation.

* Message history: time, date, source number, and destination number.

WeChat

WeChat is a Chinese multi-purpose instant messaging, social media and mobile payment app. User activity on WeChat has been known to be analyzed, tracked and shared with Chinese authorities upon request as part of the mass surveillance network in China. WeChat uses symmetric AES encryption but does not use end-to-end encryption to encrypt users messages. The FBI has less access than the Chinese authorities and can access:

* No message content.

* Accepts account preservation letters and subpoenas, but cannot provide records for accounts created in China.

* For non-China accounts, they can provide basic information (name, phone number, email, IP address), which is retained for as
long as the account is active.
